# Frontend developer test

To run this app, install dependencies and run 'npm run dev'.

# Next steps

- Develop Login screen, through a secure httpOnly cookie that permit a stored session in a cookie not allowed to be access from javascript.
- Implement several tests. This part of test have been complicated because of a bad implementation of testing library. Vite is not compatible with jest and requires a complex configuration to run, consuming most of the time to make it work. The next step should be implement a lot of tests.
- Implements validations in forms.
